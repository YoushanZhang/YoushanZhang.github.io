I will join Yeshiva University as an assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence Department from Fall 2022. I am currently a Postdoc at Cornell University. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Lehigh University. My research interests lie in the area of transfer learning, manifold learning, artificial intelligence, and shape analysis. I am also excited about interdisciplinary research, collaborating, and working with researchers from related fields.

**I am looking for high self-motivated Ph.D. students. Please send me your CV if you are interested in machine learning and computer vision (require: math background).**
