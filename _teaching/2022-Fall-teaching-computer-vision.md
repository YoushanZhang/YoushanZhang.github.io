COURSE OVERVIEW 
======

Image analysis and computer vision are important to enable machines (computers) to understand the world and have become extremely important and popular in recent years. This course focuses on fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and interests in image analysis and computer vision. Topics to be covered include image formation, image filtering, edge detection, image classification/segmentation/regression, convolution neural network, deep learning, objection detection, semantic segmentation, etc. This course will enable students to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to solve various medical and industrial problems and learn to apply these techniques in research or industry.


COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
======
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

•	Understand the major concepts in image analysis and computer vision 

•	Know a range of computer vision techniques and where to apply them

•	Understand state-of-the-art of deep learning architectures

•	Obtain practical experience in implementing real-world projects and build their own models for effective problem solving



REQUIRED MATERIALS
======

Programming: 

●	Projects are to be completed and graded in Python. Basic programming skills in Python are required.

Required Texts:

●	Richard, Szeliski. [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, 2nd edition (2021)](https://szeliski.org/Book/).
